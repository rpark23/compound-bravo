      * @dev Admin only. Sets initial proposal id which initiates the contract, ensuring a continuous proposal id count
      * @param governorAlpha The address for the Governor to continue the proposal id count from
      */
    function _initiate(address governorAlpha) external {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "GovernorBravo::_initiate: admin only");
        require(initialProposalId == 0, "GovernorBravo::_initiate: can only initiate once");
        proposalCount = GovernorAlpha(governorAlpha).proposalCount();
        initialProposalId = proposalCount;
        timelock.acceptAdmin();
    }
```

    function _initiate() external {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "GovernorBravo::_initiate: admin only");
        require(initialProposalId == 0, "GovernorBravo::_initiate: can only initiate once");
